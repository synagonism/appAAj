==============================================================================
2001.12.16: QUICK SEARCH OF A CONCEPT:
		To quickly find a concept given a SYNONYM, I can make
		ALPHABETICAL-LISTS (FILES) OF ALL SYNONYMS
		(syntactical-synonyms, synonyms of syntactical-synonyms, and the diferent forms of them).
		Then depending on the first letter of the synonym, I 'll search a relatively
		small file.
		Now, I have list of concepts with their synonyms.  In the same way, when I will
		create a new concept, the program automatically will create the lists of synonyms.

2001.07.28: MULTIPLE CONCEPTBASES:
		The program must have the ability to manage (create, compare, integrate, ...)
		many conceptbases. (each conceptbase is a MODEL of reality).
		** Then every CptModel must stored in a different directory in 'concept' directory
		and a cpt's formal-name must indicate its cptmodel eg:
		process@nikkas@phil-22. 2001.09.27

2001.03.09: english name
		IF the locale is not english, it is useful to present and the
		english-name for comparison reasons.

2001.03.07: RELATIONS SC-ELEMENTS:
		idea: How about to add <rel> elements like:
			<REL FRnAME="SpecificComplementRelation@phil-x.xml" LASTMODIFIED="2001.03.07" CREATED="2001.03.07" AUTHOR="HoKoNoUmo">
			ConceptX@phil-x
			</REL>
		This way in cpts like car-color, we don't create any new cpt:
		The 'color-relation'
		is inherited and the 'relatad' is a 'specific-color'.

2001.03.05: SYNONYMS:
		In synonyms xml-elements I will put and <SHORTNAME> AND
		<INCOMPLETENAME> elements.
		This will help a parser to find the mapping info from logos.

2000jun09: VIEWER:
		To make presentation faster, I can put on generic xml-attribute the
		generic-attribute and the inheritor cpt.
		This way I have not to compute the inheritor for each cpt when I'm displaying a cpt.

2000jun07: VIEWER:
		To display
		- partial-complements of a cpt and
		- specific-complements (siblings)

		I can display the above from a function, and remove the element 'siblings'
		in the the sc xml-file. 2000.06.08

2000may22: SYNONYMS
		To add noun/adjective/verb/adverb forms of a concept.  I need more work to find how.
		<syn>
			<noun>
				<form>...</form>
				<form>...</form>
			</noun>
			<adjective>
				<form>...</form>
				<form>...</form>
			</adjective>
		</syn>

		<syn>
			<noun>goodness, goodnesses</noun>
			<adjective>good, better, best</adjective>
		</syn>

		To write the irregular types. IF not, to produce the regular types by rules.
		NOUN: xxx, xxxs, xxx's (xxy,xxies) (box,boxes)
		ADJECTIVE: xxx, xxxer, xxxest
		VERB: xxx, xxxed, xxxing, xxxs (xxe,xxed,xxing, xxes)

2000apr25: FUNCTION CPT-MERGING
		IF 2 cpts have the same referent, then the system must MERGE
		them in one cpt.

2000apr24: WHOLE-GENERIC CLEANING
		IF a whole-relation contains 2 objects and one is part of the other
		THEN it must contain only the 'part' of the two.
		IF a generic-relation contains 2 objects and one is specific of the other
		THEN it must contain only the 'specific' of the two.

2000apr19: NAMES FUNCTION
		To add a retrieval function that shows the names/synonyms of the concepts
		I've created in number/formalname/normalname order. (Collections.sort(List))

		VIEW-ALL FUNCTION
		To create a frame with all the relations of a concept, per level.
		From a text field to choose also different cpts to show.

2000apr08: SHORT-NAMES
		* To check if it is useful to use short-names to express the names of atts, etc.
		* To use the short-name to express formal-name.

2000apr07: DIMENSIONS
		Manage dimensions.

2000mar24: undo storage-function.
		The system must have the ability to undo any storage-function, atleast the last.

2000mar20: sc with many gens.
		put on 'GENERICiNHERITOR=' more files and separate them by commas.

2000mar17: adding new cpt.
		The system must say IF exists another cpt with the SAME-NAME with the one
		we created.

2000mar16: internal/file functions.
		To add the functions:
		internal to file
		file to internal

2000mar16: concrete/abstract specific
		Except of dimensions in subs to add concrete/abstract relations.

2000feb18: VIEWER - formating text.
		I can use a JEditorPane instead of TextArea, so I can display formating
		text using html.

2000jan24: SEARCHING:
		VIEWER:
		For inflectional-languages we can add procedures to translate the name to
		nominative-case and then search for it.

2000jan02: VIEWER: linking.
		I'm waiting xml linking to use it.

2000jan02: EDITOR: WYSIWYG
		I want to make an editor like ms frontpage where you don't see the xml source.

1999may01: VIEWER: configure.
		Add menuitem to show the number of integrated and the non-integrated concepts.

		Maybe I must divide this menu to:
		INFO: for author/kbs/statistics...
		LANGUAGE: to choose a lang. This is the only thing to config in pure-viewer.

		In a pure-viewer I must remove edit-menu.  Also I can make the viewer applet.

1999feb23: EDITOR/VIEWER: cpt's name:
		When we READ or INTEGRATE a concept, and the CURRENT-cpt 'reads' other
		related-cpts by its id, THE SYSTEM must check if the names (the current-cpt
		has and filename of the other cpt) are the same.  If not, the current-cpt's
		name must change because the filename is always the new name a concept has.

1999feb22: EDITOR/VIEWER: editMenu:
		add delete concept and fix the implied relations.

1999jan18: EDITOR:
		must have search/replace functions.

							BUGS / ERRORS
==============================================================================
==============================================================================
** SEARCH FRAME:
		IF a cpt's file-name does not include '@', searching stops.
		[1999apr25]

** DUPLICANT IDs:
		IF 2 concepts have the same id, THEN the program displays the one finds first.
		[1999apr16]

** ERROR VIEWER: I couldn't display a concept.
		An ' " ' was missing in an attribute of the element 'concept'.
		[1999apr13]

** BUG EDITOR:
		IF there is a 'comment' inside attributes, editor doesn't works.
		[1999apr13]

** BUG: EDITOR: total integration
		Does NOT work if there is an empty 'dimension'
		[1999feb27]

** BUG: EDITOR:
		IF a sc has more than ONE empty line, editor can't be displayed.
		[1999feb24]

** BUG: If a concept have FAKE att-cpts, give messages on standard output.
		[1999feb13] >>>This is not a bug!
